Downloads the audio of a video from Youtube with multiple people talking. <br>
You have to label the data as in 'log.txt'. <br>
The format is seconds concatenated with minutes of start, space, same but the end and then the letters indicating who 
is talking. 1 letter = 1 person.
The starting seconds, ending seconds and who was talking in that interval. <br>
From those, the neuronal network will analyze the audio and learn to classify the people talking at a certain point,
in any audio. <br>
